## 🧪 Sample Test
**Input:**  
> The proliferation of digital technologies and ubiquitous connectivity has engendered profound transformations in the modalities of human interaction, information dissemination, and knowledge acquisition. However, this rapid technological evolution also precipitates multifaceted challenges, encompassing issues of digital literacy, data privacy, and the exacerbation of socio-economic disparities.

**Output:**  
> Digital technology and the internet have changed how people talk, share, and learn. But this growth also brings problems like lack of skills, privacy risks, and bigger gaps between rich and poor.
